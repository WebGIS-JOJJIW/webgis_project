# WebgisUi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.5.

## Development server
Runing `ng serve` creates a development server locally to serve the UI that connects to the backend in the "Development" environment". To connect to different environments see the table below for commands.

| Environment | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Local | `ng serve --configuration=local` |
| Development (**default**) | `ng serve --configuration=development` |
| Production | `ng serve --configuration=production` |

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Running `ng build` with different configuration will create artifacts specifically connecting to a particular environment. For building artifacts connecting to different environments see the table below.
| Environment | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Local | `ng build --configuration=local` |
| Development | `ng build --configuration=development` |
| Production (**default**) | `ng build --configuration=production` |

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
